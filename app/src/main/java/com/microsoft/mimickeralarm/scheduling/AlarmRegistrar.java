 * This BroadcastReceiver is registered to be called for the following system intents:

 * Time/Date/Timezone change - We re-register with the AlarmManager when any of these changes happen
 * in the system.
 *
 * Note that this receiver is called in the main thread, so there should not be any thread safety
 * issues with interfering with the alarm user interface functionality.
 *
 * Once we have re-registered alarms, we check to see if we need to display a notification by
